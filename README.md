# BikeStores-sales-analysis



## Overview

The aim of this project is to enhance your cricket data analysis skills by assembling a dream cricket team using data from the 2022 T20 World Cup. The project involves data acquisition, data cleansing, data transformation, and the development of interactive dashboards to showcase the top 11 players.

## Project Stages

1. **Data Acquisition**

    In this phase, I utilized Python-based web scraping to gather cricket data from ESPNcricinfo.com. This involved collecting statistics and performance metrics of players from various international teams participating in the 2022 T20 World Cup.

2. **Data Cleansing and Preparation**

    After acquiring the data, I performed data cleansing and preparation using Python with Pandas. This step ensured that the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

3. **Data Transformation and Visualization**

    The heart of the project involved transforming and visualizing the data using PowerBI and DAX queries. This allowed for in-depth analysis and the identification of the top 11 players based on specific performance metrics.

4. **Dashboard Deployment**

    To share the results effectively, interactive Power BI dashboards were created. These dashboards provide users with the ability to explore player statistics, discover trends, and select the dream team.
